1) Build a docker image
	docker build -t <image_name> .
2) Run a container
	docker run <image_name>
	docker run -d -p Hostport:ContainerPort <image_name>:<version_number> 

3) CMD command
	when we give some argument while running the container command like below. It will replace or override the command in the docker file
	eg: 
		1) Let us assume we have something like below in the docker file
			FROM centos:centos7
			CMD ["yum","-y","install","git"]
		2) Assume we have created an image with name demo-app with the above docker file
		3) Now we are running the container with the below command and giving hello as an argument
			docker run demo-app hello
		4) Result : It will replace the CMD input with hello
4) ENTRYPOINT command
	when we give some argument while running the container command like below. It will append the command in the docker file
	eg:
		1) Let us assume we have something like below in the docker file
			FROM centos:centos7
			ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install","git"]
		2) Assume we have created an image with name demo-app with the above docker file
		3) Now we are running the container with the below command and giving httpd as an argument
			docker run demo-app httpd
		4) Result : It will append the ENTRYPOINT input with httpd

5) ENTRYPOINT and CMD command in the same file.
	ENTRYPOINT will take CMD argument as an input
	eg:
	 1) Let us assume we have something like below in the docker file
			FROM centos:centos7
			ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install"]
			CMD ["git"]
	2) In the above Entrypoint will run something like this yum -y install git

6) How to replace the command in the entrypoint to someother command 
	eg:
	1) Let us assume we have something like below in the docker file
			FROM centos:centos7
			ENTRYPOINT ["yum","-y","install"]
	2) Assume we have created an image with name demo-app with the above docker file
	3) Now we are running the container with the below command
		docker run --entrypoint useradd demo-app palani-user-id
